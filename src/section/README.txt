ForkJoin Practice

This project is for you to get some practice with parallel programming using ForkJoin. 
We recommend going in this order:
- LessThan7 (RecursiveTask<Integer>): A relatively Simple Example
- CountStrs (RecursiveTask<Integer>)
- PowMod (RecursiveAction)
- Parity (RecursiveTask<Boolean>): Requires a difficult merge step
- SecondSmallest (RecursiveTask<TwoSmallest>): Uses a data structure

Please read the comments in each file for instructions.
